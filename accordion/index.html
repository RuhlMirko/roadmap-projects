        <h2>What are the plans for roadmap.sh?</h2>
        <p>
          Our long-term plan is to make roadmap.sh a go-to place for developers
          whenever they plan on learning something new. We started with
          roadmaps, guides, videos and other visual content but we plan on
          introducing best practices, best-practices for certain tasks, quizzes
          to test your knowledge and prepare yourself for the interviews,
          project ideas to work on while following the roadmaps, public profiles
          to share your progress and interact with the other learners and so on.
